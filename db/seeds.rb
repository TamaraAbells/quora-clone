  What the programmer really wants to say:

  “It’s software. Of course we could do it. But:

  it would take a very long time,
  you can’t afford it,
  we can’t sell it to anyone else because it’s a terrible idea,
  by the time we finish it, you won’t want it anymore.”
  “No” is just easier to say and is less insulting, especially when the client has a dozen of these ‘great’ ideas.
