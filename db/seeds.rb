  What the programmer really wants to say:

  we can’t sell it to anyone else because it’s a terrible idea,

  “No” is just easier to say and is less insulting, especially when the client has a dozen of these ‘great’ ideas.

Mathematics was not available at University College, so he pursued Physics instead. After three years and not very much work, he was awarded a first  class honours degree in Natural Science. During his time at Cambridge Professor Hawking has written a large number of publications.
